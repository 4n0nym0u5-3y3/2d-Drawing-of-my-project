# Laser Holder Design

## Overview:

This project involves the design of a **laser holder** with adjustable arms. The holder is designed to securely mount a laser and allow for precise positioning. The two adjustable arms can be opened and closed depending on the specific application, providing flexibility in how the laser is aimed or held.

## Design:

- **Function:**  
  The central hub is the core of the laser holder, designed to securely mount the laser. It features a circular section in the center, which may be used to hold the laser or connect to a larger assembly. 

- **Details:**
  - The hub includes a hole in the center, likely intended for a fastener or a pivot point, allowing the holder to be mounted onto a base or other structures.
  - The surrounding area of the hub is designed to provide structural integrity and support to the adjustable arms.

### Adjustable Arms

- **Function:**  
  The two arms extending from the central hub can be adjusted to either open or close, depending on the laser's required position or the specific task at hand. This adjustability makes the holder versatile for different operational setups.

- **Design Specifications:**
  - **Length of Arms:**  
    The arms are designed with lengths ranging from approximately 1.54 to 2.98 units
  - **Width of Arms:**  
    The arms have varying widths to ensure they can support the weight of the laser while allowing easy adjustment. The widths vary between 0.84 and 1.03 units.
  - **Angles:**  
    The arms are positioned at specific angles to the central hub, ensuring stable support when opened or closed. The design allows for smooth movement and locking in place at the desired position.
